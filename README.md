# Bikeshare

## Overview of the statistical analysis:

The purpose of the analysis is to identify trends inside a month’s worth of bike share data from New York City. Two friends will use the data to compile a briefing that will be delivered to potential investors in a similar bike share company in Des Moines, Iowa. The analysis is designed to identify trends along five distinct areas:
- ride duration per ride
- ride duration broken down by gender 
- trips by weekday by hour
- trips by weekday by hour and gender
- trips by weekday by hour by gender and whether the rider is a subscriber or not. 

Additionally, I included two additional charts which analyze top start and stop points and bike utilization. This will provide some idea as to how many bikes might be required to replicate the project in Des Moines. The presentation can be viewed at https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/arnold.felix.kaluza/viz/NYCBikeshare_16547400605290/NYCBikeRideshare?publish=yes 

## Results:

### Ride Duration
The purpose of examining trip duration is to determine how customers are using the bikes. Trip duration will also inform the maintenance schedule, how far bike docking stations should be located away from each other and, among other things, the profitability per ride. 

We can see that the vast majority of rides are less than 20 minutes, with the largest number of rides lasting only 6 minutes. From this, we can glen that people are likely to use the program for distances that are over a mile away but less than three. This is a key insight for the friends as they determine the potential demand for a similar bike share service in Des Moines. They also need to consider if trips above one mile might be more easily made in a car than a similar trip in New York would be.

### Ride Duration by Gender
The purpose of examining trip duration by gender is to gain a more granular understanding of how men and women differ in their usage of the city bike program.    

We can see that the ride duration distribution by gender is consistent with the overall ride duration distribution with males comprise approximately 50-65% of total rides between 1 and 35 minutes. This is consistent with expectations given their higher overall usage of the service. What is notable though is the gender divide generally disappears for rides lasting over 45 minutes. While these rides make up a small share of overall rides, they potentially make up a good portion of the firm’s revenue. This could indicate that men use the bike share service for short commutes to and from the office, but for longer rides (probably tourism related), male and female behavior is similar.

### Trips by Weekday and Hour
The purpose of examining the number of rides per weekday by hour is to gain a better understanding of when the bikes are most used. This will allow the friends to determine the best time to scheduled maintenance and reposition the bikes, as well as gain a better understanding on how people use the bikes for their transportation needs. 

We see there is a significant uptick in bike usage between 8am to 9 am and 4 pm to 7 pm on weekdays and from 10 am to 6 pm on Saturdays. We can draw the conclusion that many people rely on the bikes for their commute to their jobs during the week and rely on them to get around throughout the day on the weekends. 

This will be an important insight for the friends to keep in mind as they prepare their pitch, the investors will undoubtably ask what the friends can tell them about their target customer. It can also inform the friends about the viability of such a program in Des Moines. They need to answer the question if the city is conducive to commuting to and from work via bicycle.

### Trips by Weekday, Hour, and Gender
The purpose of examining the number of rides per weekday by hour by gender is to gain an even more granular understanding of when and who are using the bikes. This will allow the friends to better determine their most likely customers. This will also allow them to tailor advertising that will be critical to quickly building a solid customer base to make the business a going concern.  

We know that males make up 65.28% of all riders while females comprise 25.1% with the remaining 9.62% being unknown. Examining the data, it appears males are much more likely to use the bikes to commute to work as would be expected given their higher use of the service. The overall dispersion of rides is similar with females making up a smaller but elevated number of riders during peak commuting hours during the week and during the day on weekends.

### Trips by Weekday, Hour, Gender, and Subscriber Status
The purpose of examining the number of rides per weekday by hour, gender, and subscriber status is to further understand the customer base. By examining the chart, we can see that non-subscriber renters make up a very small percentage of the overall customer base. The business is heavily reliant on male subscriber who use the bikes to commute to and from work. This is a key insight as if this demographic does not exist in Des Moines, then the likelihood of the friend’s business being successful is very low.

### Top Start and Stop Points
By examining the top starting and ending points of rides, we can gain a better understanding of how customers are using the bikes. The previous analysis focused on time and date of the rides, but these maps will give us an understanding about both what the customers are doing (going to work or to tourist areas) and to get a better understanding about the supply and demand. Comparing the two charts will also help us understand if supply is well matched with demand. It will also give the friends a good idea on which type of neighborhoods they should focus on first when starting the Des Moines bikes share program.

### Bike Utlization
The purpose of the bike utilization chart is to identify how often each bike is used over the course of the month as this will inform the friends if a comparable number of bikes will be sufficient for their envisioned project in Des Moines. Too few bikes and they will be overused, will not be available for maintenance, and could endanger the whole project as customers will not be able to rent a bike when they want. Too many bikes and the whole project might fail as the revenue generated will be too low to cover the upfront capital cost of the new bikes. 

We can see that bike usage follows are pretty uniformed distribution where approximately 5% of the bikes were rented over 400 times and about 5% of the bikes were not rented at all over the course of the month. This could indicate to the friends that they will need to ensure to track each bike’s maintenance records individually and rotate stock frequently to ensure a uniform wear in the inventory.

## Summary:
The friends will need to do their market research to determine if the business can be replicated in Des Moines, but the presentation can inform them on areas they should examine first. The most important question to answer is if Des Moines is conducive to commuting via bicycle. Weather, traffic patterns, distance between commercial districts and residential areas, and topography all will play a part in determining if this is the case or not. 

Two additional analysis the friends should conduct is an analysis of topography in New York vs the most popular starting and stopping points. This can help inform them of how terrain impacts the bike share program. I would also want to examine the bike share data for different time periods to determine bike usage for commuting during cold weather or off-peak tourist seasons. This would provide a fuller understanding of the elasticity of demand for the bike share program other times of the year. 

Overall, the friends have a good start to their project and have a visually appealing presentation for potential investors.
