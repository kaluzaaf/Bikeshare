# Bikeshare

## Overview of the statistical analysis:

The purpose of the analysis is to identify trends inside a month’s worth of bike share data from New York City. Two friends will use the data to compile a briefing that will be delivered to potential investors in a similar bike share company in Des Moines, Iowa. The analysis is designed to identify trends along five distinct areas:
- ride duration per ride
- ride duration broken down by gender 
- trips by weekday by hour
- trips by weekday by hour and gender
- trips by weekday by hour by gender and whether the rider is a subscriber or not. 

Additionally, I included two additional charts which analyze top start and stop points and bike utilization. This will provide some idea as to how many bikes might be required to replicate the project in Des Moines.

## Results:

### Ride Duration

### Ride Duration by Gender

### Trips by Weekday and Hour
The purpose of examining the number of rides per weekday by hour is to gain a better understanding of when the bikes are most used. This will allow the friends to determine the best time to scheduled maintenance and reposition the bikes, as well as gain a better understanding on how people use the bikes for their transportation needs. 

We see there is a significant uptick in bike usage between 8am to 9 am and 4 pm to 7 pm on weekdays and from 10 am to 6 pm on Saturdays. We can draw the conclusion that many people rely on the bikes for their commute to their jobs during the week and rely on them to get around throughout the day on the weekends. 

This will be an important insight for the friends to keep in mind as they prepare their pitch, the investors will undoubtably ask what the friends can tell them about their target customer. It can also inform the friends about the viability of such a program in Des Moines. They need to answer the question if the city is conducive to commuting to and from work via bicycle.

### Trips by Weekday, Hour, and Gender
The purpose of examining the number of rides per weekday by hour by gender is to gain an even more granular understanding of when and who are using the bikes. This will allow the friends to better determine their most likely customers. This will also allow them to tailor advertising that will be critical to quickly building a solid customer base to make the business a going concern.  

We know that males make up 65.28% of all riders while females comprise 25.1% with the remaining 9.62% being unknown. Examining the data, it appears males are much more likely to use the bikes to commute to work as would be expected given their higher use of the service. The overall dispersion of rides is similar with females making up a smaller but elevated number of riders during peak commuting hours during the week and during the day on weekends.

### Trips by Weekday, Hour, Gender, and Subscriber Status

### Top Start and Stop Points
By examining the top starting and ending points of rides, we can gain a better understanding of how customers are using the bikes. The previous analysis focused on time and date of the rides, but these maps will give us an understanding about both what the customers are doing (going to work or to tourist areas) and to get a better understanding about the supply and demand. Comparing the two charts will also help us understand if supply is well matched with demand. It will also give the friends a good idea on which type of neighborhoods they should focus on first when starting the Des Moines bikes share program.

### Bike Utlization
The purpose of the bike utilization chart is to identify how often each bike is used over the course of the month as this will inform the friends if a comparable number of bikes will be sufficient for their envisioned project in Des Moines. Too few bikes and they will be overused, will not be available for maintenance, and could endanger the whole project as customers will not be able to rent a bike when they want. Too many bikes and the whole project might fail as the revenue generated will be too low to cover the upfront capital cost of the new bikes. 

We can see that bike usage follows are pretty uniformed distribution where approximately 5% of the bikes were rented over 400 times and about 5% of the bikes were not rented at all over the course of the month. This could indicate to the friends that they will need to ensure to track each bike’s maintenance records individually and rotate stock frequently to ensure a uniform wear in the inventory.
