# Bikeshare

## Overview of the statistical analysis:

The purpose of the analysis is to identify trends inside a monthâ€™s worth of bike share data from New York City. Two friends will use the data to compile a briefing that will be delivered to potential investors in a similar bike share company in Des Moines, Iowa. The analysis is designed to identify trends along five distinct areas:
- ride duration per ride
- ride duration broken down by gender 
- trips by weekday by hour
- trips by weekday by hour and gender
- trips by weekday by hour by gender and whether the rider is a subscriber or not. 

Additionally, I included two additional charts which analyze top start and stop points and bike utilization. This will provide some idea as to how many bikes might be required to replicate the project in Des Moines.

## Results:

### Ride Duration

### Ride Duration by Gender

### Trips by Weekday and Hour

### Trips by Weekday, Hour, and Gender

### Trips by Weekday, Hour, Gender, and Subscriber Status

### Top Start and Stop Points
By examining the top starting and ending points of rides, we can gain a better understanding of how customers are using the bikes. The previous analysis focused on time and date of the rides, but these maps will give us an understanding about both what the customers are doing (going to work or to tourist areas) and to get a better understanding about the supply and demand. Comparing the two charts will also help us understand if supply is well matched with demand. It will also give the friends a good idea on which type of neighborhoods they should focus on first when starting the Des Moines bikes share program.

## Summary:

There is a high-level summary of the results and two additional visualizations are suggested for future analysis (5 pt)
